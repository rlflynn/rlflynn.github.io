		<p>One thing to take into consideration when designing for mobile is the ability to change the website when the technology changes and the ability to keep up with the times. Technology and devices change so fast in the age that we live in that a website that is difficult to reprogram is not something desirable. Another thing that coincides with changing the format of the website is to remember that although most people are viewing on their smartphones, not all smartphones are alike. The website design has to be compatible with a multitude of different screens, and easily accessed by a mobile device as well. Small buttons and text can make it incredibly difficult to navigate on a device that sits in the palm of your hand. 

		An important thing to remember is your content stacking strategy. Taking the information from the desktop design of the website and putting it in order of how you want the mobile user to receive it is a tough task. You need to keep the core content of what the website is delivering, and reorder it so that it makes sense in a more vertical format, rather than having it all laid out with plenty of breathing room on a bigger screen. Consider the content moving with the page as it is condensed, stacking on top of each other as the space becomes limited. This will allow for easier navigation as well as improve your user experience.</p>
